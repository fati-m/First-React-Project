# First-React-Project
A random project I made while first starting to learn React JS

# What it contains:
1. A graph with random avocado sale information from 10 cities gathered from an excel sheet
2. A field where you can enter a string. When entered, it returns "Hello, *string input*!" as well as the same string reversed
3. At the bottom of the page there is a button that when clicked shows an alert in the browser

# To Access: 
1. Download files and open in VS Code
2. In the VS Code terminal, type "npm start"
